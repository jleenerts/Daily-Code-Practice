# Daily-Code-Practice
Now that I have a public GitHub for personal use I figured I would start with some basic practice for myself (and also to get plenty of commits building up, heh).
I also invited my friend Michael to join me to better increase accountability on both sides.

# Format
Each daily practice will reside in a separate folder. I will be writing my code in C++ and including a makefile so that each problem can be compiled and run by itself (I need practice with makefiles anyway).
